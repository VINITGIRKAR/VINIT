Certainly! Below is a step-by-step guide to verify whether **MySQL, phpMyAdmin, MariaDB, Redis, and Docker** are successfully installed and running on your **Ubuntu (WSL)** system.

---

### **1. Check MySQL**
MySQL is often replaced by MariaDB in Ubuntu, but if you installed it separately:

#### **Check if MySQL is running:**
```bash
sudo systemctl status mysql
```
- If active (`Active: active (running)`), MySQL is running.
- If not installed/enabled, you may see `Unit mysql.service could not be found.`

#### **Login to MySQL:**
```bash
mysql -u root -p
```
- Enter your password when prompted.
- If successful, youâ€™ll see the MySQL prompt (`mysql>`). Type `exit` to leave.

---

### **2. Check MariaDB**
MariaDB is a drop-in replacement for MySQL.

#### **Check MariaDB status:**
```bash
sudo systemctl status mariadb
```
- `Active: active (running)` means it's working.

#### **Login to MariaDB:**
```bash
sudo mariadb -u root
```
- If successful, youâ€™ll see the MariaDB prompt (`MariaDB [(none)]>`). Type `exit` to leave.

---

### **3. Check phpMyAdmin**
phpMyAdmin is a web-based MySQL/MariaDB administration tool.

#### **Check if Apache/Nginx is running (required for phpMyAdmin):**
```bash
sudo systemctl status apache2   # If using Apache
# or
sudo systemctl status nginx     # If using Nginx
```
- Should be `active (running)`.

#### **Access phpMyAdmin in browser:**
- Open your browser and go to:
  ```
  http://localhost/phpmyadmin
  ```
- If you get a login page, it's working. Log in with your MySQL/MariaDB credentials.

#### **Check phpMyAdmin files:**
```bash
ls /usr/share/phpmyadmin
```
- If the directory exists, phpMyAdmin is installed.

---

### **4. Check Redis**
Redis is an in-memory data store.

#### **Check Redis status:**
```bash
sudo systemctl status redis-server
```
- `Active: active (running)` means it's working.

#### **Test Redis CLI:**
```bash
redis-cli ping
```
- If it responds with `PONG`, Redis is running.

---

### **5. Check Docker**
Docker allows containerization.

#### **Check Docker service status:**
```bash
sudo systemctl status docker
```
- Should show `Active: active (running)`.

#### **Verify Docker installation:**
```bash
docker --version
```
- Should return something like `Docker version 20.10.12, build e91ed57`.

#### **Run a test container:**
```bash
docker run hello-world
```
- If you see `Hello from Docker!`, Docker is working correctly.

---

### **Troubleshooting Common Issues in WSL**
- **If `systemctl` doesnâ€™t work in WSL**:  
  WSL doesnâ€™t fully support `systemd`. Instead, manually start services:
  ```bash
  sudo service mysql start    # or mariadb
  sudo service redis-server start
  sudo service docker start
  ```
- **If phpMyAdmin isn't accessible**:  
  Ensure Apache/Nginx is running and configured correctly.
- **Docker not starting?**  
  You might need to start Docker Desktop (Windows) and ensure WSL integration is enabled.

### **Summary of Commands to Verify Everything**
| Service     | Check Status Command       | Test Command               |
|-------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|
| **MySQL**   | `sudo systemctl status mysql` | `mysql -u root -p`         |
| **MariaDB** | `sudo systemctl status mariadb` | `sudo mariadb -u root`     |
| **phpMyAdmin** | Check Apache/Nginx + `http://localhost/phpmyadmin` | `ls /usr/share/phpmyadmin` |
| **Redis**   | `sudo systemctl status redis-server` | `redis-cli ping`           |
| **Docker**  | `sudo systemctl status docker` | `docker run hello-world`   |

If all checks pass, your setup is working correctly! Let me know if you encounter any issues. ðŸš€
